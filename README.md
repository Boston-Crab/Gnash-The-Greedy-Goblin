- Led a team consisting of a Pixel Artist, a Musician, and a Contributing Tester, successfully working together full-time on a daily basis for two months to create a product.

- My responsibilities also included GDScript programming, game design, level design, SFX design, and management. While all the required skills, aside from management, were new to me, I successfully learned and applied them.

- The project had a self imposed hard deadline which was successfully reached by all team members.

If youâ€™re interested in seeing the games GDScript code or project structure (I am not able to share it publicly due to some sound assets having a specific copyright), please feel free to contact me via email, so that we could arrange a meeting.
